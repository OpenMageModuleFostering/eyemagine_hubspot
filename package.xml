    <summary>Integration with Magento and HubSpot which syncs Magento customers with HubSpot&#xD;
Contacts along with customer attributes, order history, abandoned carts, recent&#xD;
history, and lifetime statistics.</summary>
    <description>Connecting Magento and HubSpot helps you increase online sales from new customers and increase repeat sales from existing customers. This connector passes all customer data and attributes from your Magento store into HubSpot, including: &#xD;
&#xD;
&#x2022; Order Information &#xD;
&#x2022; Recent Activity &#xD;
&#x2022; Browser Type &#xD;
&#x2022; Abandoned Carts &#xD;
&#x2022; Lifetime Customer Statistics &#xD;
&#x2022; Average Order Value &#xD;
&#x2022; Items per Order &#xD;
and more... &#xD;
&#xD;
Specifically, the EYEMAGINE connector empowers you to: &#xD;
&#xD;
Automate and personalize your abandoned cart nurturing. &#xD;
&#xD;
Personalize your follow-up emails with images, URLs, and names for the most valuable products in any abandoned cart. Using the HubSpot workflow tool, you can send a timed series of personalized emails to your contacts who abandoned a cart, automating the follow-up process and increasing conversions from cart abandoners. &#xD;
&#xD;
Automate and personalize your upsell, cross-sell, and reorder emails. &#xD;
&#xD;
If you've set up your Magento shopping cart with upsell and related product details for your top sellers, then you can create personalized emails for people who purchase them. Send a timed series that automatically incorporates product images, names, and URLs for upsell and cross-sell items and start marketing like Amazon! &#xD;
&#xD;
Laser target your one-off emails and product launches. &#xD;
&#xD;
The HubSpot/Magento connector syncs all your historical data for customers, making it possible to create lists of every person who purchased particular products or categories. &#xD;
Launching a new product? Create a list of everyone who has ever purchased something similar from you, email them about the new line, and watch your engagement rates and sales soar! &#xD;
Want to send a special deal to your VIPs? You can build a list of everyone whose total order value is above a certain amount. &#xD;
Want to reengage lapsed customers? You can build a list and email people who haven't purchased in over 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, etc. &#xD;
Want to see which of your customers are also social media influencers? You can build a list of customers who have more than 10,000 followers on Twitter. The possibilities for personalized engagement are enormous. &#xD;
&#xD;
Nurture customers to become repeat customers through Social Inbox and Smart Content. &#xD;
&#xD;
HubSpot's Social Inbox and Smart Content tools help you break out of the inbox and personalize customer experience on your website and on social media. Social Inbox will show you (among many other things) a Twitter feed of all your customers, allowing you to hear what they're saying and respond with helpful content and advice, further building your relationship with them. And Smart Content will allow you to change what a visitor sees on your site according to any rules you create. Has someone purchased items in category A? Change your homepage hero image when they visit to automatically feature a product in that category, and transform your site to function like the market leaders in eCommerce. &#xD;
&#xD;
Attribute revenue generated to specific marketing channels and campaigns. &#xD;
&#xD;
Hubspot's suite of analytics and reporting tools allows you to quickly and easily see which traffic sources or marketing actions turned into revenue for you during any given time period. Generate a report in seconds and email it to anyone in the company--you can even set up recurring reports so everyone can keep track of the company's progress. </description>
